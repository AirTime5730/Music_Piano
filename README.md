# Music_Piano
A music piano app written in python.

To obtain your proper sound or instrument please refer to List_Of_SF2_Sounds.txt. The first number is the bank, the second number is the preset.

All the key signatures are in majors. If you want E Flat Major, into the input for the key signature enter the letters Eb. F# Major, just keep the hashtag. 
The TF key just makes it easier to play Toccata and Fugue. The 1 custom mapping is to play "I just died in your arms tonight" - Cutting Crew by making each key bound to a chord. 

Feel free to add your own custom mappings and add your own additions.

I used the soundfont files from https://github.com/open-soundfonts/SGM_V2_01_soundfonts.git. The list of sounds file is also from that repository. 

The program references these soundfont files in a folder named SF2.
